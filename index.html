            <p>You have never seen me but I'm hoping and trying to build a connection so that you get to know me. There is still a long way to go I'm pretty much determined to go through everything.
             A little bit struggle will be there but <span class="qt">NO PAIN,NO GAIN</span>.

            <h3> Biography</h3>
            <p>
                Well, I believe everyone should be passionate and and at the same time professional. Someone is working in a multinational company that's his profession not passion. Same goes for me, I love to play football that's my passion and to be professional I need some more time. Let's hope for the best.<span class="qt">(Though the picture is from a cricket tournament)</span>
             Here you won't find any CV as I haven't made one so here is a classical song which is also a famous one. Let's hear it.</p>
